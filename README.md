# rigger

`rigger` is your interface to deploying Deis on a variety of cloud providers.

See design discussion: https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4345

A rigger (in construction) is a person who specializes in the lifting and moving of extremely
large or heavy objects. They understand the ins and outs of static and dynamic
loads and their expertise is of paramount importance to ensure that the
components of a project are delivered safely and expediently into the exact
positions. Consider the complexities involved for a rigger when [replacing a 38
ton thruster on the DCV Balder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bti0Z5a7GmE).
Therefore, naming this tool "rigger" makes sense: it's your highly experienced
aide in lifting your Deis platform into position.
